 AUS_neutrality: "Austrian Neutrality"
 AUS_neutrality_desc: "Since 1955, neutrality has become a deeply ingrained element of Austrian identity. Legally, Austrian neutrality is both part of the Austrian constitution and of international law. There is an ongoing debate among legal scholars whether Austria could change this neutral status on its own account. This is a moot point, however, since there is no political or popular support for doing so."
